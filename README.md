# Smartphone Research Platform

## Overview

This GitHub repository provides a set of guidelines one needs in order to run C/MATLAB algorithms on Android and iOS devices. The application explored here is for hearing improvement studies, but these guidelines can serve as a good baseline for any Applied Digital Signal Processing application.

The repository covers the following aspects:
* Software tools required to implement the algorithms on smartphones
* How to run C code on Android or iOS devices
* Converting MATLAB functions into C Code using MATLAB Coder
* Hardware dependencies one needs to be aware of while implementing these algorithms
* Designing a real-time audio filtering app for both Android and iOS

## Users Guides

[Android](UsersGuide-SmartphoneResearchPlatform-Android.pdf)<br>
[iOS](UsersGuide-SmartphoneResearchPlatform-iOS.pdf)

## Prerequisites

- For iOS implementation, a Mac laptop or desktop machine is required, as well as an apple developer account
- For Android implementation, [Superpowered SDK](https://superpowered.com) has been used to set up the audio I/O, which can be found at: [LINK](https://github.com/superpoweredSDK/Low-Latency-Android-iOS-Linux-Windows-tvOS-macOS-Interactive-Audio-Platform)
- For converting MATLAB code to C, MATLAB Coder app for MATLAB is required
